Is the confusion matrix in the sklearn.metrics good enough?

Why do my predictions vary wildly?
    will have model predict all negative (all features) or all positive (occupation)

To Do
    Cross val
    Play with model
        Learning rate
        regularization params
    plot learning rate and regularization params vs accuracy

    plot decision boundary? final model
